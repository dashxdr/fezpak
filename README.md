fezpak
======

Because I am the way I am the first thing what I did after I bought [FEZ](http://fezgame.com/)
is not to play it, but to reverse engineer the package format so I can listen to the
music outside of the game.

Basic usage:

	fezpak.py list <archive>                 - list contens of .pak archive
	fezpak.py pack <archive> [files...]      - create a new .pak archive
	fezpak.py unpack <archive>               - extract .pak archive
	fezpak.py mount <archive> <mount-point>  - mount archive as read-only file system

The `mount` command depends on the [llfuse](https://code.google.com/p/python-llfuse/)
Python package. If it's not available the rest is still working.

This script is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3 (tested with 2.7.5 and 3.3.2).

File Format
-----------

The .pak file format is extremely simple. It has no file magic. The "header" is
just the number of entries it contains. A entry is just a file name (with `\`
as path seperator) and the contens of the file. All integers are encoded as
little endian.

File names don't have extensions (like `.ogg`). I don't know if this has a special
reason just happens to be the way the FEZ developers named the files.

**Note:** File names may conflict with directory names. If you unpack such an archive
you need to specify `-x EXT` or `--guess-extension` to add file name extension to all
extracted files in order resolve the name confilct.

Sometimes there is the exact same file name twice in the archive. In this case the
second occurance will overwrite the first when unpacking. When the archive is mounted
as a file system name conflict resolution is a bit different. In this case `~number`
is added between the file name and the extension. `number` is the first number that
doesn't produce a confict.

I noticed that all doubled file names in the archives of FEZ contain the exact same
content, so I guess their existance is a mistake.
